    "response": "[[\"quality of food\", \"expensive\", \"negative\"], [\"price\", \"a little too expensive\", \"negative\"]]  \n\nWait, this is conflicting. Let me correct. Since \"expensive\" directly relates to price, and \"quality of food\" is mentioned but not directly given an opinion. However, the structure \"For the quality of food, a little too expensive\" implies that the quality may not justify the price. But the explicit opinion is on the price. So the correct answer should be:\n\n[[\"price\", \"a little too expensive\", \"negative\"]]  \n\nBut according to some annotation guidelines, \"quality of food\" might be considered an aspect with a neutral sentiment if there's no explicit opinion. However, in the sentence, the mention of quality is to contrast with the price, but no direct opinion on quality. So perhaps the answer should only include the price aspect. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n[[\"price\", \"a little too expensive\", \"negative\"]]  \n\nBut the initial part mentions \"quality of food\". Maybe the aspect is \"food\" with opinion \"expensive\" and sentiment negative. But \"expensive\" refers to price. So the correct answer is [[ \"price\", \"a little too expensive\", \"negative\" ]]. \n\nBut looking back, the user's example output format includes multiple entries if there are multiple aspects. However, in this case, there's only one aspect with an opinion. So the final answer is:\n\n[[ \"price\", \"a little too expensive\", \"negative\" ]]  \n\nBut some might interpret that \"quality of food\" is an aspect without an explicit sentiment, but the task requires extracting aspects with their corresponding opinions and sentiments. Since there's no opinion on quality, it's excluded. Hence, the correct extraction is:\n\n[[ \"price\", \"a little too expensive\", \"negative\" ]]\n\n**Final Answer**\n[[\"price\", \"a little too expensive\", \"negative\"]]"
