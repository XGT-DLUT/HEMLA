    "response": "[[\"food\", \"mediocre\", \"negative\"], [\"prices\", \"mediocre\", \"negative\"]] is not entirely correct because \"mediocre\" is more related to \"food\" than \"prices\". A more accurate interpretation is that the food is mediocre given the prices, implying that the prices are high relative to the quality of the food.\n\nA more accurate response would be: [[\"prices\", \"high\", \"negative\"] is not present, so we directly relate \"mediocre\" to \"food\" and imply the sentiment towards the value for money]. However, sticking strictly to the given text and the required format, the best representation is: [[\"food\", \"mediocre\", \"negative\"]]. \n\nSo, the response is: [[\"food\", \"mediocre\", \"negative\"]]"

    "response": "[[\"service\", \"bad\", \"negative\"]] is not the only aspect, let's analyze further.\n\nThe review mentions \"drinks\" and the experience related to it. The phrase \"good to go there for drinks\" indicates a positive sentiment towards the aspect \"drinks\" or more broadly, the location or venue.\n\nHowever, the reason given for it being \"good\" is not because the service or the drinks are good, but rather because you won't get drunk due to the slow service. The aspect \"service\" is associated with the opinion \"bad\" and has a negative sentiment due to the phrase \"the service is so bad\".\n\nLet's re-evaluate the sentiment for \"drinks\". The statement \"good to go there for drinks\" suggests a positive aspect towards having drinks there, but it's under a specific condition (not getting drunk). So, the sentiment towards \"drinks\" or the venue in the context of having drinks is somewhat positive.\n\nTherefore, the extracted aspects, opinions, and"
