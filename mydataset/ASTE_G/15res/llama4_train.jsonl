Here is the correct response:\n\n [[\"crust\", \"best\", \"positive\"], [\"pizza\", \"should not have additional toppings\", is not an opinion term, instead use: \"pizza\", \"the only one that should not have additional toppings\", \"negative\" is also not correct. Instead, use: [\"toppings\", \"additional\", \"negative\"] is not accurate. The correct interpretation is: [\"pizza\", \"the only\", \"positive\"] or simply: [\"crust\", \"tastes like freshly baked bread\", \"positive\"] or  [[\"crust\", \"best\", \"positive\"]].\n\nA more accurate response is: [[\"crust\", \"tastes like the best freshly baked bread\", \"positive\"]].\n\nSo"

For the phrase \"wine selection is fairly priced\":\n   - \"wine selection\" is the aspect term.\n   - \"fairly priced\" is the opinion term. The term \"fairly priced\" generally indicates a positive sentiment because it suggests that the price is reasonable or acceptable, implying satisfaction with the pricing.\n   - The sentiment polarity is positive.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, the extracted information can be formatted as follows:\n\n[[\"drinks\", \"well made\","

The comparison to ordering off the menu for less than $18 implies a negative sentiment towards the deal but doesn't directly express an opinion on the price or the deal itself as being positive or negative, it's more of an argument against the value of the deal. \n\nSo, the final response is: [[\"choices\", \"limited\", \"negative\"]]."

However, the most suitable response is: [[\"size\", \"small\", \"negative\"]]. \n\nA more suitable analysis is as follows: The review mentions that the place is \"small\", which has a negative sentiment towards the aspect \"size\" or \"ambience\" of the place.

    "response": "To analyze the given review and extract the aspect term, opinion term, and the corresponding sentiment polarity, let's break down the sentence: \"I ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive.\"\n\n1. The review mentions \"most dishes\" as the aspect. The opinions expressed about \"most dishes\" are \"average at best\" and \"too expensive.\"\n   - \"average at best\" implies a negative sentiment because it suggests that the dishes were not impressive or exceeded expectations; they were merely average.\n   - \"too expensive\" is also negative because it indicates that the price was not justified by the quality or value perceived by the reviewer.\n\n2. Thus, for \"most dishes,\" we have two opinions with negative sentiment.\n\nGiven this analysis, the response in the required format is:\n[[\"dishes\", \"average\", \"negative\"], [\"dishes\", \"expensive\", \"negative\"]]\n\nCorrected to fit the exact terms used in the review:\n[[\"dishes"

However, in the context of a place being \"always packed\", it could imply long wait times or overcrowding which might be negative. But a more neutral interpretation is also plausible.\n\nA more accurate response could be: [[\"crowd\", \"packed\", \"neutral\"]].\n\nSo, the response is: [[\"crowd\", \"packed\", \"neutral\"]]."

For \"variety\", the opinion term is \"best\", and for \"delivery\", it is \"fastest\". \"Freshest\" also expresses an opinion about \"variety\".\n\n3. **Determine Sentiment Polarity**: Sentiment polarity refers to whether the opinion expressed is positive, negative, or neutral. \n   - \"freshest\" and \"best\" both indicate a positive sentiment towards \"variety\".\n   - \"fastest\" indicates a positive sentiment towards \"delivery\".\n\nTherefore, breaking down the review:\n- \"variety\" is described by \"freshest\" and \""

The sentiment here is somewhat complex but leans towards being neutral or slightly negative due to the implication that substance is lacking.\n\n2. \"but in this unattractive room\" - Here, \"room\" is the aspect term, \""

In this review, \"nigiri\" is the aspect term because it's the thing being discussed.\n\n3. **Opinion Term**: This is the word or phrase expressing an opinion about the aspect term. Here, \"relatively good\" is the opinion term as it expresses the reviewer's opinion about \"nigiri\".\n\n4. **Sentiment Polarity**: This indicates whether the sentiment expressed is positive, negative, or neutral. The word \"good\" generally carries a positive sentiment. Although it's modified by \"relatively\", which can somewhat temper the positivity, \"relatively good\" still leans towards a positive sentiment because it implies a comparison where \"nigiri\" is on the positive"
