Here, the phrase \"have not yet discovered\" indicates a lack of knowledge or understanding, which reflects a negative opinion towards the aspect (Apple engineers' competence or the state of their product/feature).\n\n3. **Determine the Sentiment Polarity**: The sentiment polarity is the sentiment expressed towards the aspect term, categorized as positive, negative, or neutral"

The reviewer \"wanted\" the product for its \"mobility\", indicating a positive sentiment towards the aspect \"mobility\".\n2. The phrase \"this little bad boy is very nice\" expresses a positive sentiment. Here, \"bad boy\" is an idiomatic expression that is being used to refer to the product in an affectionate or approving manner, and \"nice\" directly expresses a positive sentiment towards the product.\n\nSo, the response should be: [[\"mobility\", \"wanted\", \"positive\"], [\"product\", \"nice\", \"positive\"]]."

The opinion term is \"Exceptionally easy\" and the sentiment is \"positive\". \n\nSo the response is: [[\"mini\", \"Exceptionally easy to set up\", \"positive\"]] is also acceptable, but more accurately it can be represented as: [[\"setup process\", \"Exceptionally easy\", \"positive\"]]."

The sentiment polarity is \"negative\" because the reviewer states that the laptop is \"not as fast as expected\", indicating a negative sentiment towards its speed. \n\nCorrected response: [[\"speed\", \"not as fast\", \"negative\"]] \n\nThis is a more accurate representation as \"not as fast\" is the actual opinion term expressing the sentiment. \n\nSo the final response is: [[\"speed\", \"not as fast\", \"negative\"]]"

The second part of the sentence is \"but it's made from aluminum that scratches easily.\" The aspect term here is \"aluminum\" (more specifically, the material the product is made of), and the opinion term related to it is \"scratches easily,\" which implies a negative sentiment because it indicates a flaw or a disadvantage.

A more suitable response is: [[\"OS\", \"new\", \"neutral\"], [\"OS\", \"urgent to fix\", \"negative\"]]. However, a more precise interpretation is needed.\n\nLet's refine: The review mentions \"the new OS\" and people's complaints about it, indicating a negative sentiment towards the OS. The term \"new\" is more of a descriptor than an opinion, so it's neutral. The complaint is about the OS, indicating a negative sentiment. The urgency for Apple to fix it implies that the current state of the OS is bad (negative sentiment).\n\nThus, a more accurate extraction is: [[\"OS\", \"complain\", \"negative\"]]. However"
