    "label": "[[\"price\", \"great\", \"positive\"]]",
    "response": "[[\"computer\", \"great\", \"positive\"], [\"price\", \"great\", \"positive\"]] \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Aspect \"computer\":** The term \"great\" directly modifies \"computer,\" indicating a positive sentiment.  \n2. **Aspect \"price\":** The phrase \"for the price\" implies the computer's value relative to its cost, with \"great\" contextually extending to the price aspect (i.e., \"great value for the price\"), leading to a positive sentiment.  \n\nWhile \"little\" describes the computer, it is contextually neutral (size descriptor) and does not independently convey sentiment, so it is excluded."
