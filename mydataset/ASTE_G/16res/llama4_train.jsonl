The opinion term is \"good\", which is generally positive, but the overall sentiment expressed is negative due to the negation \"not any longer\". \n\nSo the aspect term is \"place\", the opinion term is \"good\", and the sentiment polarity is \"negative\". \n\nTherefore, the response is [[\"place\", \"good\", \"negative\"]]."

The phrase \"moderately enjoyed\" indicates a positive sentiment because \"enjoyed\" is positive, and \"moderately\" suggests a degree of that positive feeling, rather than negating it.\n\nTherefore, breaking"

A more accurate extraction would be: [[\"menu\", \"great variety\", \"positive\"]]. However, breaking it down further: [[\"variety\", \"great\", \"positive\"]] is a good representation. So a more accurate response is: [[\"menu\", \"great\", \"positive\"], [\"variety\", \"great\", \"positive\"]]. But the best representation is: [[\"variety on the menu\", \"great\", \"positive\"]]. Since \"variety on the menu\" is a phrase, we can simplify it to: [[\"menu\", \"great\", \"positive\"]]. \n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, a more accurate extraction is: [[\"menu\", \"great variety\", \"positive\"]] is still not the best.

However, since \"temperature inside the restaurant\" is not directly mentioned, a more suitable extraction directly from the given text would be: [[\"kitchen\", \"open\", \"positive\"]].

The phrase \"it's very dark and original\" further describes \"ambience\" with \"dark and original\" being the opinion terms. Although \"dark\" might have a negative connotation in some contexts, in the context of ambience, especially when coupled with \"original\" and the reviewer's expressed liking, the overall sentiment is positive. Therefore, the aspect term is \"ambience\", the opinion term is \"dark and original\", and the sentiment polarity is \"positive\"."

In this review, the aspect term is \"service.\"\n\n3. **Identifying Opinion Terms**: Opinion terms are the words or phrases that express an opinion about the aspect terms. Here, \"italian charm\" and \"constant mille grazie\" could be seen as positive descriptors, but the overall opinion is negative because it's contrasted with \"does not constitute proper service.\" The key opinion term is \"not proper,\""

The first part of the review is \"The whole set up is truly unprofessional.\" Here, \"set up\" is the aspect term, \"unprofessional\" is the opinion term, and the sentiment polarity is negative because \"unprofessional\" has a negative connotation.\n\n2. The next part is \"I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff.\" In this, \"staff\" is the aspect term, and \"good\" is the opinion term indicating a positive sentiment towards the desired state of the staff. However, the current sentiment towards the staff is implied to be negative because they are not \"good.\"\n\n3. The final part states \"because despite the current one this is a great place.\" Here,"

The phrase \"is a joke\" is an idiomatic expression that implies something is not satisfactory or is of poor quality.\n- The sentiment polarity is \"negative\" because the reviewer is expressing dissatisfaction or a negative opinion about the dessert.

For \"wine list,\" the opinion term is \"extensive,\" indicating a characteristic of the wine list. For \"meal,\" the opinion term is \"reasonably priced,\" describing the cost aspect of the meal.\n\n3. **Determine Sentiment Polarity**: Sentiment polarity refers to whether the sentiment expressed is positive, negative, or neutral. \n   - The term \"extensive\" is generally positive in the context of a wine list because it implies a wide selection.\n   - The phrase \""

A more suitable opinion term for \"wings\" would be related to \"chimmichuri\" or an implicit positive sentiment associated directly with \"wings\". However, the most straightforward interpretation based on the given text is that both \"quacamole\" and \"wings\" are liked.\n\nA more accurate representation: [[\"quacamole\", \"yummy\", \"positive\"], [\"wings\", \"are\", \"positive\"]] should be understood as both items being positively reviewed. For \"wings\", the positive sentiment is directly associated with them, likely due to being \"with chimmichuri\".\n\nSo, the response is: [[\"quacamole\", \"yummy\", \"positive\"], [\"wings\", \"with chimmichuri\", \"positive\"]]."

    "response": "[[\"meal\", \"bad\", \"negative\"], [\"service\", \"bad\", \"negative\"]] is incorrect because the sentiment is actually positive due to the negation \"never\". Here is the correct response:\n\n [[\"meal\", \"bad\", \"positive\"], [\"service\", \"bad\", \"positive\"]] is still not perfect. A more accurate representation would be: \n\n [[\"service\", \"never bad\", \"positive\"], [\"meal\", \"never bad\", \"positive\"]] or \n [[\"meal\", \"never bad\", \"positive\"], [\"service\", \"never bad\", \"positive\"]]\n\nHowever, to be more precise with the given format and understanding that \"never bad\" is the opinion term that conveys a positive sentiment, the response should be:\n\n [[\"service\", \"never bad\", \"positive\"], [\"meal\", \"never bad\", \"positive\"]] \n\nSo the final answer is: [[\"meal\", \"never bad\", \"positive\"], [\"service\", \"never bad\", \"positive\"]]."
