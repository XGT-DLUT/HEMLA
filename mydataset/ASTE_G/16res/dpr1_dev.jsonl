The aspect \"prices\" might not have an explicit opinion term. So perhaps only the first pair is correct. However, given the structure of the sentence, \"not worth the prices\" could be considered the opinion phrase for the place. Alternatively, \"prices\" might have an implied negative sentiment because they are deemed too high. But according to the task's instructions, we need explicit opinion terms. Therefore, the correct answer should be:\n\n[[\"place\", \"not worth\", \"negative\"]]\n\nBut earlier I thought \"prices\" could be an aspect with \"not worth\" as the opinion, but that might not be accurate. Let me reassess.\n\nFinal answer after correction:\n\n[[\"place\", \"not worth\", \"negative\"]]"
